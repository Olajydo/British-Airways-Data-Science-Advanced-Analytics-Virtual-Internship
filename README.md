## Introduction
During this virtual internship, I had the opportunity to work on real-world data analytics projects related to the aviation industry. The tasks focused on utilizing data to gain insights, create predictive models, and make data-driven decisions to optimize various aspects of the airline's operations.

## Project Overview
1. **Flight Delay Prediction Model:** Developed a machine learning model to predict flight delays and identify factors that contribute to delays.

2. **Customer Segmentation Analysis:** Conducted customer segmentation analysis to better understand different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

3. **Demand Forecasting for Route Optimization:** Utilized time series forecasting to predict demand for different flight routes, optimizing flight scheduling and resource allocation.

## Skills Developed
- Data preprocessing and cleansing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning and predictive modeling
- Time series forecasting
- Data visualization and storytelling

## Tasks Accomplished
- Analyzed large datasets to extract meaningful insights and trends.
- Developed and evaluated machine learning models to solve real-world business problems.
- Presented findings and recommendations to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure data-driven decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau
- SQL
- Git
